# NOTICE

In this repository, I will completed some basic algorithms of machine learning by using Python.

## 1. PLA

    PLA stands for perceptron learning algorithm. It's a simple method for problem about binary classification. The file pla.py have implemented the perceptron learning algorithm by two forms.

Before we use the pla, the separating hyperplane is not well:

After we used the pla, the separating hyperplane is perfect:
